 * This is an example of using middleware in routes. The global middleware group will be
 * applied to all routes. The before middleware will be executed before the policy
 * handler ran, and the after middleware group will be executed right after the main
 * callback (the main route handler) ran without any exceptions/interruptions.
 * The route middleware will be run if any middleware is explicitly used.
 */

/**
 * Note: Please use class-based middleware when you need more than a few to keep
 * this confine clean and store the middleware in the Http/Middleware folder.

 * How to use route middleware:

 * $router->namespace(...)->before('auth')->after('loger')->group(...);
